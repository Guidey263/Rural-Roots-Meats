                    <p>At Rural Roots Meats, the quality of our pork begins long before it reaches your kitchen. It starts in the open fields of our farm, where our pigs live freely, forage naturally, and enjoy a life that's as close to their natural state as possible. This commitment to pasture-raising isn't just a trend for us; it's the core of our philosophy.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What Does "Pasture-Raised" Really Mean?</h3>
                    <p>Unlike pigs raised in conventional systems, our animals aren't confined to small pens. They have ample space to roam, root, and explore. This freedom allows them to engage in natural behaviors, which significantly reduces stress and promotes better health. A happy, stress-free pig not only lives a better life but also produces meat that is more tender and flavorful.</p>

                    <h3>A Natural Diet for Superior Flavor</h3>
                    <p>Our pigs' diet is a key factor in the final product. They forage for roots, grasses, and other natural food sources, which we supplement with a carefully balanced, non-GMO feed. We strictly avoid the use of hormones and unnecessary antibiotics. This natural diet contributes to a richer, more complex flavor profile in the meat that you simply can't find in commercially-raised pork.</p>

                    <p>When you choose our pasture-raised pork, you're not just getting a delicious meal. You're supporting a system that values animal welfare, environmental sustainability, and the time-honored traditions of farming. It's a difference you can feel good about and a taste you won't forget.</p>
