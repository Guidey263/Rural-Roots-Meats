                        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1-2 racks of pork ribs</li>
                            <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                            <li>1.5 cups your favorite BBQ sauce</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Instructions:</h4>
                        <ol>
                            <li>**Preheat Oven and Prep Ribs:** Preheat your oven to 300°F (150°C). Remove the thin membrane from the back of the ribs. Pat them thoroughly dry.</li>
                            <li>**Make the Rub:** In a small bowl, combine paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and salt.</li>
                            <li>**Season the Ribs:** Generously rub the spice mixture all over both sides of the ribs.</li>
                            <li>**Wrap the Ribs:** Wrap each rack of ribs tightly in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place on a baking sheet.</li>
                            <li>**Bake the Ribs:** Bake for 2 to 2.5 hours, or until the meat is tender.</li>
                            <li>**Apply BBQ Sauce:** Carefully unwrap the ribs. Brush BBQ sauce generously over both sides.</li>
                            <li>**Glaze and Broil/Bake:** Return the ribs to the oven, uncovered, for another 20-30 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly. For an extra sticky glaze, broil for the last 2-3 minutes, watching closely.</li>
                            <li>**Rest and Serve:** Let the ribs rest for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</li>
                        </ol>
